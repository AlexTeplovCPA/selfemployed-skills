# selfemployed-skills

AI workflow skills for self-employed Canadians preparing for tax filing or CPA review.

These skills are built from real practice with IT contractors, mortgage agents, trades contractors, and real estate professionals in Canada. Each skill runs as a structured conversation: the AI asks questions, reads uploaded documents, fills gaps, and produces organized output ready for a CPA to review.

These skills are a domain-specific extension of cpa-skills.

## Who This Is For

Self-employed Canadians who want to organize their tax information before working with a CPA. The skills handle the preparation layer. The CPA handles review, classification, and filing.

Practitioners working with self-employed clients who want a consistent intake workflow before the engagement begins.

These skills are not a substitute for professional tax advice or CPA review. They organize what you have. A CPA validates and completes it.

## Disclosure

These workflows organize information provided by the user. They do not verify completeness or accuracy, provide tax advice, or create a professional relationship of any kind. Use of these skills does not replace a review by a qualified CPA before filing.

## How the Skills Work Together

The general skills form a preparation sequence. Run them in order, or run the ones relevant to your situation.

`01-identifying-income-sources` is the starting point. The other skills assume it is complete or in progress.

Run `02-checking-gst-hst` early if you are unsure about your registration status or have crossed CAD 30,000 in revenue. Do not leave this for last.

Profession-specific expense classification skills, such as `03-classifying-expenses/it-contractor`, run after the income picture is clear.

`04-preparing-cpa-t1-package` pulls everything together into a personal tax package ready to send to a CPA. It assumes the prior steps are complete or partially complete.

`05-preparing-cpa-t2-package` covers the corporate side for incorporated owner-managers. Run it alongside `04-preparing-cpa-t1-package` when both a T1 and a T2 are being filed in the same engagement.
