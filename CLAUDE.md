# CLAUDE.md — it-contractors-skills

Client-facing AI workflow skills for Canadian IT contractors.

This repository contains structured preparation workflows for users who want to:

- organize their tax information
- prepare for CPA review
- or enter their return into tax software themselves

These workflows organize, map, and flag information. They do not:

- provide tax advice
- verify completeness or accuracy
- determine final filing positions
- replace CPA judgment

Built by Alex Teplov, CPA.

## Platform-Specific Files

Files like `agents/openai.yaml` are optional. Add them only when packaging for a specific platform. They are not part of the default repository structure.

---

## Skill Naming Rules

Use:

- kebab-case
- lowercase only
- clear functional naming

Examples:

- collecting-tax-documents
- identifying-income-sources
- organizing-t2125-gross-business-income
- organizing-t2125-8523-meals-and-entertainment
- checking-gst-hst
- generating-self-entry-summary

Avoid:

- underscores
- camelCase
- vendor-specific names
- audience suffixes

---

## Frontmatter Rules

Each `SKILL.md` must include:

```yaml
---
name: identifying-income-sources
description: organize income sources for a canadian it contractor and prepare them for tax entry or cpa review.
---
```

Description must:

- explain what the skill does
- explain when to use it
- be specific and practical
- stay under 1024 characters

---

## Skill Structure

Keep `SKILL.md` concise. Recommended structure:

```markdown
# Skill Name

## Purpose

## Core Rules

## Inputs

## Workflow

## Output Requirements

## Status Guidance

## Boundaries

## Related Uses
```

---

## Shared Schema

Use shared schemas across all skills.

### Input schema

Defines:

- user profile
- income
- expenses
- documents
- flags

Stored in: `references/shared-input-schema.md`

### Output schema

Defines:

- mappings
- flags
- questions
- status
- summary

Stored in: `references/shared-output-schema.md`

This is what makes skills interoperate.

---

## Required Rules

### Data handling

Include when needed:

> Do not type your SIN, business number, account numbers, or client names. Redact sensitive data before uploading.

### Accuracy boundary

State clearly:

- information is organized, not verified

### No tax advice

Always:

- organize
- flag
- question

Never:

- conclude filing positions

### Stop condition

Use:

> That is outside what this workflow covers. It is a question for a CPA before you file.

---

## Writing Rules

Use:

- short sections
- direct instructions
- consistent wording
- american spelling
- no em dashes

Prefer:

- organize
- map
- flag
- review
- collect

Avoid:

- long explanations
- legal language
- marketing tone

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` small. Move large content to `references/`.

Do not:

- duplicate schemas
- create deep folder nesting

---

## Build Priority

Start with this chain:

1. collecting-tax-documents
2. identifying-income-sources
3. identifying-expense-categories
4. organizing-t2125-gross-business-income
5. organizing-t2125-routine-operating-expenses
6. organizing-t2125-8523-meals-and-entertainment
7. generating-self-entry-summary
8. generating-missing-items-summary

Only expand after this works.

---

## Quality Checklist

Before committing:

- names match folder and frontmatter

- schema is respected
- file is concise

---

## Git Conventions

Use clear commit messages:

- `Add identifying-income-sources skill`
