## Category to Form Line Mapping

Use this table to orient the CPA when handing off the classified output. Category names in the skill are functional, not form-line labels. This mapping shows where each category lands on T2125 (T1 sole proprietor) and on a corporate income statement feeding into T2 Schedule 1.

| Category | T2125 Line (T1) | T2 Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Cost of goods sold | 8300 (purchases) / 8320 (direct wages) | Cost of sales on income statement |
| Subcontractors | 8340 | Subcontracts on income statement |
| Professional fees | 8860 | Professional fees on income statement |
| Software and subscriptions | Other expenses, line 9270 (itemized) | Other expenses on income statement |
| Home office | 9220 (rent) / 9281 (business-use-of-home calc) | Reasonable allocation; personal portion not deductible |
| Vehicle | 9281 motor vehicle expenses | Motor vehicle expenses; personal-use taxable benefit applies for T2 |
| Meals and entertainment | 8523 (50% limitation applied by CPA) | Same; 50% limitation applies |
| Capital purchases | Not on T2125; enter CCA schedule (class determined by CPA) | Not expensed; capitalized and depreciated via CCA |
| Bank and financing fees | 8710 | Interest and bank charges on income statement |
| Other business expenses | 9270 (other expenses, itemized) | Other expenses on income statement; CPA reviews each item |

**Notes for the CPA:**

Software and subscriptions has no dedicated T2125 line. Each item is listed individually under other expenses at line 9270. For high-volume contractors this section can be long.

Capital purchases do not appear as expenses anywhere on T2125 or the corporate income statement. They enter the CCA schedule. The CPA determines the correct class: Class 10 (general equipment, 30%), Class 50 (computers, 55%), Class 12 (software, 100% in year of acquisition) are the most common for IT contractors.

Home office on T2125 flows through the business-use-of-home calculation, which limits the deduction to business income and cannot create a loss. Carry-forward rules apply.

Vehicle expenses for a T2 corporation require a standby charge and operating benefit calculation if the vehicle is owned by the corporation and available for personal use. This is separate from the business-use percentage applied on T1.
