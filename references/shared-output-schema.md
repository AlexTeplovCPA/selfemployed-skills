# Shared Output Schema

Use this schema for all skill results.

The purpose of this schema is to keep skills modular but interoperable. A broad intake skill, a narrow field skill, and a final summary skill should all be able to work from compatible outputs.

This schema is internal. The end user does not need to see it exactly in this format.

```yaml
decisions_deferred:
  - "No final conclusion made on deductibility"
```

### downstream_effects

What later skills may need to use.

```yaml
downstream_effects:

```

### status

- `low`
- `unknown`

### client_safe_summary

Plain-language result that can be shown directly.

```yaml
client_safe_summary:

  missing_items:
    - "Business purpose for restaurant charge"
  caution_notes:
    - "Do not rely on unsupported meal charges without clarification."
```

### internal_notes

Optional internal guidance for later synthesis.

```yaml
internal_notes:
  reviewer_style_note: "Weak descriptions on several items"
  synthesis_hint: "Group with travel meals if travel skill also triggers"
```

---

## Minimum Viable Output Schema

If a skill only needs a smaller version, it must still include:

```yaml
skill_result:
  skill_name:
  case_id:
  scope:
  mappings_proposed:
  flags:
  open_questions:
  status:
  confidence:
  client_safe_summary:
```

---

## Required Output Rule

Every skill in this repository should end with at least:

- `mappings_proposed`
- `flags`
- `open_questions`
- `status`
- `client_safe_summary`

Broad intake skills may have fewer field mappings. Narrow field skills should usually have stronger mapping detail. Final synthesis skills may rely more heavily on aggregated prior results.

---

## Skill Use Rule

Skills should:

- use the shared output shape
- preserve uncertainty where support is incomplete
- separate mapping from unresolved questions
- avoid giving filing advice through the output language
- produce client-safe summaries in plain language
